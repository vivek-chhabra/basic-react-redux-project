# Basic React Redux Project 🚀

**This is a simple project that demonstrates the usage of Redux to manage the state of a React application. It also utilizes a placeholder API to handle asynchronous state management. The project is built using React, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, and Redux.**

## Branches and State Management Approaches 🌿

This project has two main branches, each using a different approach to manage the state:

### **main** Branch

The **main** branch of this project utilizes traditional Redux for state management. It demonstrates how to set up actions, reducers, and the Redux store manually to manage the application's state.

### **toolkit-main** Branch

The **toolkit-main** branch of this project showcases the usage of Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux Toolkit provides a set of utility functions and simplifies the process of creating Redux actions and reducers. It demonstrates how to create slices, define actions, and set up the Redux store using the toolkit.

Both branches provide valuable insights into different methods of managing state using Redux, allowing you to compare and contrast the traditional approach with the more streamlined toolkit approach.

## Features ✨

- Redux store setup for global state management.
- Integration of Redux Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous actions.
- Interaction with a placeholder API to simulate asynchronous data fetching.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This project makes use of the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe UI components.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive and stylish web design.
- **Redux**: A state management library for maintaining global application state.
- **Redux Thunk**: A middleware for Redux that allows handling of asynchronous actions.
- **Placeholder API**: Simulated API interactions for showcasing asynchronous data fetching.

These technologies work together to create a dynamic user interface while efficiently managing the application's state using Redux.
