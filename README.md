# Basic React Redux Project 🚀

**This is a simple project that demonstrates the usage of Redux to manage the state of a React application. It also utilizes a placeholder API to handle asynchronous state management. The project is built using React, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, and Redux.**

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This project makes use of the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe UI components.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive and stylish web design.
- **Redux**: A state management library for maintaining global application state.
- **Redux Thunk**: A middleware for Redux that allows handling of asynchronous actions.
- **Placeholder API**: Simulated API interactions for showcasing asynchronous data fetching.

These technologies work together to create a dynamic user interface while efficiently managing the application's state using Redux.
